# Trending-Analysis-based-on-Machine-Learning
Record companies invests hundreds of millions of dollars each year in discovering new singers. Therefore, finding what accurately produce hit song will bring huge benefits to the music industry. In this project, our goal is to judge the value of a song and predict what the hit song will look like in 2020 by focusing on using different machine learning algorithms. We use a dataset contains Top Spotify songs from 2010 to 2019 by year to do experiments. In the process, we do exploratory analysis on our dataset and test different algorithms.
